## Some important libraries used in this project : 
yfinance is a Python library with a user-friendly interface for downloading historical market data from Yahoo Finance. It lets you get historical stock prices, dividends, and other financial data for stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and other securities.

### Dividends 
Dividends are the distribution of a companys profits to shareholders. In this case they are defined as an amount of money returned per share an investor owns. Using the variable `dividends` we can get a dataframe of the data. The period of the data is given by the period defined in the 'history` function.
