## Welcome to line plots. 

### What is a line plot? 
 As its name suggests, it's a plot that displays information as a series of data points connected by straight lines. It is one of the most basic types of charts and is common in many fields, not just data science. Let's identify when to use a line plot.

Line plots are useful for visualizing trends and changes over time, making them a popular choice for time-series data, such as changes in stock prices, website traffic, or temperature fluctuations. 

You can also use a line plot to show relationships between two variables,they can also be used to compare multiple data series on one chart. 

Line plots can also effectively highlight sudden changes or anomalies in data. As an example, from our dataset, we can generate a line plot to see the trend of immigrants from Haiti to Canada. Based on this line plot, we see that there is a spike of immigration from Haiti to Canada in 2010. 
We can then research for justifications of obvious anomalies or changes from a quick Google search for major events in Haiti in 2010 one would easily learn about the tragic earthquake that took place in 2010. Therefore, this influx of immigration to Canada was mainly due to that tragic earthquake.

### how can we generate this line plot, 
    as we briefly mentioned in an earlier video with matplotlib, all we have to do is call the plot function on the pandas data frame or series containing the data of interest. Before we go over each code. 
    
    To do that, let's do a quick recap of our data set. Each row represents a country and contains data corresponding to the status of the country in terms of where it is located geographically and whether it is developing or developed. Each row contains numerical figures of annual immigration from that country to Canada, 1980-2013. Now let's process the DataFrame so that the country name becomes the index of each row. This should make querying specific countries easier.

    Also, let's add an extra column which represents the total immigration for each country, from 1980-2013. 
    For Afghanistan, it's 58,639, for Albania, it's 15,699, and so on. Now, let's name our DataFrame, df_canada. 
    
    Now that we know how our data is stored in the DataFrame df_canada. Let's generate the line plot corresponding to immigration from Haiti.
