### Welcome to introduction to Matplotlib. 
After watching this video, you'll be able to explain what Matplotlib is and why it was created. Describe the uses for Matplotlib. 

Matplotlib is one of the most widely used data visualization libraries in Python. 

It was created by John Hunter, who was an American neurobiologist. 

John Hunter was part of a research team analyzing electro CTO cartography, ECoG signals, and use proprietary software for this task. 
However, the team had only one license and was taking turns using it.
'

To overcome this limitation, John Hunter set out to replace the proprietary software with a Matlab based version that could be utilized by him and his teammates and extended by multiple investigators. 

As a result, Matplotlib was initially developed as an EEG and ECoG visualization tool. 

Just like Matlab, Matplotlib was equipped with a scripting interface for quick and easy generation of graphics represented by the plot. 

As for Matplotlib's architecture, it's composed of three main layers. 
The backend layer, the artist layer, where much of the heavy lifting happens, is the appropriate programming paradigm when writing a web application server, a UI application, or a script to be shared with other developers. 

The scripting layer is the appropriate layer for everyday purposes. 

It's considered a lighter scripting interface to simplify common tasks and for quick and easy generation of graphics and plots.

The backend layer has three built-in abstract interface classes. FigureCanvas defines end encompasses the area on which the figure is drawn. Renderer, an instance of the renderer class knows how to draw on figure canvas. The event handles user inputs such as keyboard strokes and mouse clicks. The artist is the object that knows how to take the renderer and put ink on the Canvas. Everything you see in a Matplotlib figure is an artist instance. The title, the lines, the tick labels, the images, and so on, all correspond to an individual artist.


There are two types of artist objects. 

Primitive: Line2D, Rectangle, Circle, and Text. Composite: Axis, Tick, Axes, and Figure. The top-level Matplotlib object that contains and manages all the elements in each graphic is the figure artist. 

The most important composite artist is the axis because it's where most of the Matplotlib API plotting methods are defined, including methods to create and manipulate the ticks, the axis lines, the grid, and the plot background. 
Each composite artists may contain other composite artists as well as primitive artists. 
A figure artists can have an axis artist, a rectangle, and a text artist.

The artist layer is syntactically heavy. 
Programmers work directly with the backend and artists layers as they offer greater convenience while integrating Matplotlib with application servers. 
When it comes to the daily tasks of scientists involving data visualization or exploratory interactions, the scripting layer known as Pyplot works better. 

Matplotlib scripting layer is the Matplotlib.Pyplot interface, which automatically defines a Canvas and a figure artist instance and connects them. 

Let's generate a histogram of 10,000 random numbers with the scripting layer. 
First we import the Pyplot interface and you can see all the methods associated with creating the histogram and other art objects and manipulating them. Whether the hist method or showing the figure is part of the Pyplot interface.

Notice the use of Numpy's random module with random.randn for creating random floats from the Pyplot hist method is called, hist creates a sequence of rectangle artists for each histogram bar and adds them to the axes container. 

To the hist function, we have passed the variable X containing an array of 10,000 random numbers and 100, which means creating 100 bins. 

The result is a histogram. It's simple to work in the scripting layer. The anatomy of a plot refers to the different components and elements that make up a visual representation of data. '
There's a reference on the official website of Matplotlib titled Anatomy of figure. 
This image provides a complete guide to understanding what a plot may include based on your requirements.

The main component is the window or Canvas containing the plot or subplots. 
Matplotlib figure as a Canvas and axes represents an individual plot within a figure, you must first create two-axes parts to make two plots on one figure, the axis provides scales and tick marks for plotting the data. 
The actual data being plotted is represented as points or markers on the plot like the axis. 
A good plot must have a title to provide a summary or explanation of the plot. 
Likewise, labels describe data being plotted on each axis. 
You may like to include a legend to explain the meaning of different elements or data series and applaud a grid to help visually aligned data points and aid and reading values from the plot and annotations to provide supplemental information or explanations about specific data points are regions in the plot. 
You can choose symbols for individual data point, colors, and styles.
