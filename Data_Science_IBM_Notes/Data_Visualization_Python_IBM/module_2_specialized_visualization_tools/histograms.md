## Welcome to Histograms. 

### Histogram : 
    A histogram is a way of representing the frequency distribution of a numeric data set. The way it works is that it partitions the spread of the numeric data into bins, assigns each data point in the data set to a bin, and then counts the number of data points assigned to each bin. So, the vertical axis is essentially the frequency or the number of data points in each bin. For example, let's say the range of the numeric values in the data set is 34,129. Now, the first step in creating a histogram is partitioning the horizontal axis in, say, 10 bins of equal width.

    Then we construct the histogram by counting how many data points have a value that is between the limits of the first bin, the second bin, the third bin, and so on. Say, the number of data points that have a value between 0 and 3,413 is 175, then we draw a bar of that height for this bin, we repeat the same step for all the other bins. And if no data points fall into a bin, then that bin would have a bar of height zero. 

### So how do we create a histogram using Matplotlib? 

    Let's process the data frame so that the country name becomes the index of each row, this should make retrieving rows pertaining to specific countries a lot easier. Also, let's add an extra column that represents the cumulative sum of annual immigration from each country from 1980 to 2013, so for Afghanistan it's 58,639 total, and for Albania it's 15,699, and so on. And let's name our data frame df_canada.

    Considering the Canada immigration data set, having countries as the index, and having another column as total represents the cumulative sum of annual immigration from each country from 1980 to 2013. 
    
    Say we want to visualize the distribution of immigrants to Canada in the year 2013, the simplest way to do that is to generate a histogram of the data in column 2013. Let's see how we can do that with Matplotlib, first, we import Matplotlib as mpl and its scripting interface as plt. Then we call the plot function on the data in column 2013 and we specify kind=hist to generate a histogram, then, to complete the figure, we give it a title and label both its axes. Finally, we use the show function to display the figure, and there you have it: a histogram that depicts the distribution of immigration to Canada in 2013. 
    
    But notice how the bins are not aligned with the tick marks on the horizontal axis, this can make the histogram hard to read. So, let's try to fix this in order to make our histogram more effective.

    One way to solve this issue is to borrow the histogram function from the NumPy library, so as usual, we start by importing Matplotlib and its scripting interface, but this time we also import the NumPy library, then we call the NumPy histogram function on the data in column 2013. This function is going to partition the spread of the data in column 2013 in ten bins of equal width, where ten is the default number of bins. 
    
    It also computes the number of data points that fall in each bin and then return this frequency of each bin which we are calling ‘count’ here, and the bin edges which we will call ‘bin_ edges’. We then pass these bin edges as an additional parameter in our plot function to generate the histogram, and there you go. A precisely generated histogram with the bin edges and tick marks clearly aligned on the horizontal axis. 
    
    In this video you learned that: a histogram is a way of representing the frequency distribution of a numeric data set. To generate a histogram on Matplotlib, you import Matplotlib as mpl and its scripting interface is plt.
