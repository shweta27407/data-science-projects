# Data Sceince Methodologies

As a general science methodology, data methodology consists of the following 10 stages. 
1. Business understanding,
2. analytic approach,
3. data requirements,
4. data collection,
5. data understanding,
6. data preparation,
7. modeling,
8. evaluation,
9. deployment, and
10. feedback.


## Questions drive every stage of data science methodology. Data science methodology aims to answer the following 10 basic questions which align with the data methodology questions. 
  **These first two questions help you define the issue and determine what approach to use.**
1. what is the problem that you're trying to solve?
2. How can you use data to answer the question?
   ** You'll use the next four questions to help you get organized around the data. You'll ask,**
3. what data do you need to answer the question,
4. where's the data source from, and how will you receive the data?
5. Does the data you collect represent the problem to be solved and
6. what additional work is required to manipulate and work with the data?
   **Then you'll use these final four questions to validate your approach and final design for ongoing analysis.**
7. when you apply data visualizations, do you see answers that address the business problem?
8. Does the data model answer the initial business question or must you adjust the data?
9. Can you put the model into practice?
10. Can you get constructive feedback from the data and the stakeholder to answer the business question?

# Common Analytic Approach 

When choosing an analytic approach for a problem, the type of question you’re trying to answer greatly influences the methodology. Here are five common types of questions and corresponding analytic approaches:

## 1. Descriptive Questions: “What is the current status?”
Approach: Descriptive Analytics

### Question:  "What is the current status of our sales?"  

Techniques:

Data aggregation: Combining data from various sources into a unified view.

Data mining: Extracting useful information from large datasets.

Data visualization: Using visual tools to present data in an easily understandable format.

Examples:

Summarizing sales data

Creating dashboards

Generating reports


## 2. Diagnostic Questions: “Why did it happen?”
Approach: Diagnostic Analytics

### Question: "Why did our sales decline in the last quarter?"  

Techniques:

Drill-down: Exploring detailed data to find underlying causes.

Data discovery: Identifying patterns and relationships in data.

Correlation analysis: Assessing the relationship between different variables.

Examples:

Identifying root causes of sales decline

Analyzing customer complaints

Understanding failure points in a process


## 3. Predictive Questions: “What is likely to happen?”
Approach: Predictive Analytics

### Question: "What is our sales forecast for the next year?"  

Techniques:

Regression analysis: Predicting outcomes based on relationships between variables.

Time series forecasting: Predicting future values based on past trends.

Machine learning models: Using algorithms to predict future outcomes based on historical data.

Examples:

Forecasting sales

Predicting customer churn

Estimating future demand


## 4. Prescriptive Questions: “What should we do?”
Approach: Prescriptive Analytics

### Question: "What should we do to increase website traffic?"  

Techniques:

Optimization models: Finding the best solution from a set of alternatives.

Simulation: Modeling scenarios to predict outcomes.

Decision analysis: Evaluating and comparing different decisions.

Examples:

Recommending inventory levels

Optimizing marketing campaigns

Determining pricing strategies


## 5. Classification Questions: “Which category does this belong to?”
Approach: Classification (Supervised Learning)

### Question: "Which category does this data point belong to?"   

Techniques:

Logistic regression: Predicting the probability of a categorical outcome.

Decision trees: Splitting data into branches to classify it.

Support vector machines: Finding the best boundary to separate categories.

Neural networks: Using interconnected nodes to classify data.

Examples:

Email spam detection

Image classification

Disease diagnosis


Understanding these different types of questions and the corresponding analytic approaches can help you unlock your data's true potential.
