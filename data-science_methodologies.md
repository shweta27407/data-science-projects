5. data understanding,
6. data preparation,
7. modeling,
8. evaluation,
9. deployment, and
10. feedback.


## Questions drive every stage of data science methodology. Data science methodology aims to answer the following 10 basic questions which align with the data methodology questions. 
  **These first two questions help you define the issue and determine what approach to use.**
1. what is the problem that you're trying to solve?
2. How can you use data to answer the question?
   ** You'll use the next four questions to help you get organized around the data. You'll ask,**
3. what data do you need to answer the question,
4. where's the data source from, and how will you receive the data?
5. Does the data you collect represent the problem to be solved and
6. what additional work is required to manipulate and work with the data?
   **Then you'll use these final four questions to validate your approach and final design for ongoing analysis.**
7. when you apply data visualizations, do you see answers that address the business problem?
8. Does the data model answer the initial business question or must you adjust the data?
9. Can you put the model into practice?
10. Can you get constructive feedback from the data and the stakeholder to answer the business question?
