Raw data must pass through various Data Science task categories, such as data management, data integration and transformation, 
data visualization, model building, model deployment, and model monitoring and assessment.

Data management tools are MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Apache CouchDB, Apache Cassandra, Hadoop File System, Ceph, and elastic search. 
Data integration and transformation tools are Apache AirFlow, KubeFlow, Apache Kafka, Apache Nifi, Apache SparkSQL, and NodeRED. 
Data Visualization tools are Pixie Dust, Hue, Kibana, and Apache Superset. 
Model deployment tools are Apache PredictionIO, Seldon, Kubernetes, Redhat OpenShift, Mleap, TensorFlow service, TensorFlow lite, and TensorFlow dot JS. 
Model monitoring tools are ModelDB, Prometheus, IBM AI Fairness 360, IBM Adversarial Robustness 360 Toolbox, and IBM AI Explainability 360. 
Code asset management tools are Git, GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. 
And finally, data asset management tools are Apache Atlas, ODPi Egeria, and Kylo.
